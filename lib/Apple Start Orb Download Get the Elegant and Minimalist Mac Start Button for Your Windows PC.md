## Benefits of Apple Start Orb for Windows 7
` `
Besides giving your desktop a sleek and stylish look, using an Apple start orb for Windows 7 may also have some benefits for your health and well-being. Here are some reasons why you might want to try this customization:
` `
`
`- It may boost your mood. Apples are known to have a positive effect on your mood, as they contain antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that can help reduce stress and depression. According to a study, eating an apple a day was associated with higher levels of happiness and mental well-being ( 11 ). By having an Apple start orb on your screen, you may feel more cheerful and motivated throughout the day.
`
`- It may improve your memory. Apples are rich in flavonoids, a type of antioxidant that can protect your brain cells from oxidative damage and inflammation. Flavonoids may also enhance cognitive function and memory by improving blood flow to the brain and stimulating the growth of new neurons ( 12 ). By using an Apple start orb for Windows 7, you may be reminded of the benefits of apples for your brain health and performance.
`
`- It may support your weight loss goals. Apples are high in fiber and water, which can help you feel full and reduce your appetite. Eating apples regularly may also lower your risk of obesity and related diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease ( 13 ). By choosing an Apple start orb for Windows 7, you may be inspired to eat more apples and other healthy foods as part of your diet.
`
`
` `
Of course, these benefits are not guaranteed by simply using an Apple start orb for Windows 7. You still need to eat actual apples and follow a balanced diet and lifestyle to enjoy their health effects. However, having an Apple start orb on your screen may serve as a visual cue and a reminder of the importance of eating fruits and taking care of yourself.
