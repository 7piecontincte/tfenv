Memento, the company behind the world's first smart photo frame that can display high-resolution digital images with realistic colors and details, has released a new firmware update for its 35-inch and 25-inch models. The firmware version 1.3 128 introduces several new features and improvements that enhance the user experience and performance of the Memento smart photo frame.
 
One of the main features of the new firmware is the ability to create and manage playlists of photos directly from the Memento app on your smartphone or tablet. You can now select multiple photos from your device or cloud storage and add them to a playlist, which you can then send to your Memento frame or share with other Memento users. You can also edit, delete, or reorder your playlists at any time.
