# How to Convert Vitalsource Ebooks to PDF Format
 
Vitalsource is a popular platform for online textbooks and e-learning materials. However, some users may prefer to have their ebooks in PDF format for offline reading, printing, or sharing. Unfortunately, Vitalsource does not provide an easy way to convert their ebooks to PDF format. In fact, they only allow you to print two pages at a time from their online bookshelf.

So how can you convert Vitalsource ebooks to PDF format? There are a few methods that you can try, but they may not work for all ebooks or devices. Here are some of the options that you can explore:
 
## Method 1: Use a Python Script
 
One of the most popular methods to convert Vitalsource ebooks to PDF format is to use a Python script that scrapes the webpages of the ebooks and creates an offline replica with the print tags removed. This script was created by a GitHub user named kchurch981 and can be found [here](https://github.com/kchurch981/VitalSource_PDF_Converter).[^1^]
 
This method requires some technical skills and prerequisites, such as installing Python, Selenium, and ChromeDriver on your computer. You also need to have a Vitalsource account and a Chrome browser version 81.x installed. The script works by asking you to enter the webpage of the desired chapter of the ebook, your username and password, and then scraping the webpage for the content HTML. It then converts the data into a usable form and prints it to a PDF file in your downloads folder.
 
This method has some limitations, such as needing to repeat the process for each chapter of the ebook, not working for some ebooks with complex formatting or images, and possibly violating the terms of service of Vitalsource. Use this method at your own risk and discretion.
 
## Method 2: Use Cheat Engine
 
Another method to convert Vitalsource ebooks to PDF format is to use a software called Cheat Engine that can modify the values of applications running on your computer. This method was suggested by a Reddit user named Drumdrum98 and can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/avwueh/is_there_a_way_to_convert_vitalsource_vbk_books/).[^2^]

This method requires you to download and install Cheat Engine on your computer and hook it into the print dialog of the Vitalsource Bookshelf app. You then need to edit the first page and last page numbers to be 0 (cover) and the last page of the book, respectively. This will bypass the limit of printing only two pages at a time and allow you to print the entire book to a PDF file. You may also need to run the PDF file through an OCR software (such as Adobe Acrobat Pro) if you want to be able to search or copy text from it.
 
This method has some drawbacks, such as possibly leaving watermarks on the pages, not working for some ebooks with DRM protection or encryption, and potentially violating the terms of service of Vitalsource. Use this method at your own risk and discretion.
 
## Method 3: Manage Your Devices
 
A third method to convert Vitalsource ebooks to PDF format is to manage your devices from your Vitalsource account and deactivate any devices that you no longer use or need. This will free up some activations that you can use on other devices or apps that support PDF conversion. For example, you can use Calibre or Epubor Ultimate on your computer or tablet to convert your ebooks to PDF format.
 
This method requires you to go to the [VitalSource Account Center](https://account.vitalsource.com/devices) [^3^]and sign in with your username and password. You then need to click on Devices in the navigation bar and find the device that you wish to deactivate. Click on the Deactivate button and confirm your action. You can then sign into Bookshelf with your login credentials on another device or app that supports PDF conversion.
 
This method has some advantages, such as being legal, simple, and effective for most ebooks. However, it also has some limitations, such as having a maximum of two
