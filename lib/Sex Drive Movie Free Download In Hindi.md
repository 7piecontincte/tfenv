In Haven Island, Agent 47 must infiltrate a tropical paradise that serves as a secret hideaway for wealthy criminals. His targets are the resort's owner, a former MI6 agent turned rogue, and two of his guests, a shady tycoon and a disgraced politician. The DLC promises to offer a variety of ways to eliminate the targets, from using the resort's amenities to exploiting the island's natural hazards.

Hitman 2 is the sequel to the 2016 reboot of the stealth action franchise. It features six main locations, from Miami to Mumbai, where players can explore and execute their missions with creativity and freedom. The game also supports importing locations from the previous game, Hitman, for those who own both games. Hitman 2 has received positive reviews from critics and fans alike, praising its gameplay, level design, and replay value.
