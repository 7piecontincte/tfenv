# Qarshi Medicine: A Natural and Effective Way to Heal Yourself
 
Qarshi Medicine is a brand of herbal products manufactured by Qarshi Industries, one of the largest natural products companies in Pakistan. Qarshi Medicine offers a range of products for various health problems, such as cough, cold, sore throat, diabetes, blood pressure, liver, kidney, skin, hair, and more.
 
Qarshi Medicine is based on the principles of Unani medicine, a system of healing that originated in ancient Greece and was developed by Muslim physicians. Unani medicine believes that health is a balance of four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) in the body. Any imbalance in these humors causes disease. Qarshi Medicine uses natural ingredients such as herbs, minerals, and animal products to restore the balance of humors and treat the root cause of the disease.
